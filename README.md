# badgers-shopping
All the good stuff that comes to mind in relation to badgers and their shopping habits.

Actually, this has nothing to do with Meles meles nor their purchasing preferences.

I'm an IT professional with nearly 30 years of experience. I started off as a "programmer" working on IBM Mainframes using COBOL. I still don't understand CICS! I then moved into Windows development using Visual Basic while Windows 3.0 was still a thing. I can still recall watching an actual Window "draw" on an early IBM Thinkpad back in the 1980s and coveting my team leader's Compaq desktop as it had 32MB of disk and a sound card.  Then .Net, C#, some time with Java and exposure to whole host of database technologies. I've worked in financial services and the travel & tourism industries for all of that time and only regret no trying to spread my wings a little further to experience other domains.

I've been fortunate (I like to think I've worked hard too) to rise through the ranks and have a role I'm truly proud of. But that role has taken me further away from the my passion. My passion remains directing and hands-on designing and developing software and solutions to problems; business problems. There's nothing more rewarding than being told that you've just made someone's job easier. At heart, I'm a geeky tech' who enjoys watching the broad canvas of patterns, frameworks, solutions and products expand. Keeping up is the tough job. Find the time to get may hands dirty, tougher still.

Since the whole world woke up to the philosophy of Open Source, keeping up has almost become impossible, in my opinion. But the aggregate of very smart people's ideas, efforts, examples and teachings is something I'm keen to make the time to benefit from.   

To add some context to this repo, I think Microservices are a good thing and here to stay (subject to natural evolution). 

Besides the concepts of "API-everything" and domain-driven problem solving (which is still very important, generally, as well as to me personally), they help us solve problems that, even today, get overlooked or kicked down the road, or blatantly ignored despite EVERYONE having suffered from them: performance, scalability, resilience (self healing) and speed to market. These are VERY real issues that remain commonplace, not just in legacy systems but in new products too. Vertical scaling is not the answer (not long term answer, anyway). Its hard and expensive. I dare say that I'll revise this statement further as we go.

This repo is just the start of my journey into the world of Microservices from scratch - watch this space /repo......
